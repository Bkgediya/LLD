//Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (fields/variables) and behavior (methods) together into a single unit (class)
//and restricting direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components

//--> Achieved using access modifiers (private, public, protected).
//--> Protects data from unauthorized access or modification.
//--> Provides data hiding + controlled access.
